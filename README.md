# Mountain Biking Story Map

> Storyline

​	I choose to go with less of a storyline and more of an informational tale about a few of my favorite trails in the McDonald Dunn trail system. 

> Display

​	I used a video I found online for the opening scene of a mountain biker to display what my story map is about. I also used a black base map to outline the trail systems that I created on geoJson.io to make the curvature stand out. And I used satellite imagery to show the extent of the McDonald Dunn Forest Area to give the viewer a sense of what the area looks like. 

> Story

​	Each trail has a description provided and some information about the length and climb/descent features of that trail. This information was obtained from Team Dirt's website and there is a link provided in the credits.
